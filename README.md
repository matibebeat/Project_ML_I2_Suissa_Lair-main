# Project_ML_I2_Suissa_Lair
Project done by Léanna Suissa and Mathis Lair


Throughout this course, we explored various foundational concepts in machine learning. We began by studying the Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) algorithm, advanced through perceptrons, and concluded with models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These models represent some of the most powerful techniques in machine learning today, enabling remarkable achievements in various applications.
In this report, we focus on a specific subtype of DNN known as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), widely used for image recognition. For our project, we applied CNNs to the Cifar 10 dataset, a collection of encrypted images designed to test model accuracy in recognizing patterns under complex transformations. CNNs excel at tasks like these and hold significant potential in fields like medicine, where they may one day play a crucial role in diagnostics and treatment planning.

prerequisites and informations : 
For our project, we used several key libraries:
NumPy: Essential for handling arrays and matrix operations, allowing efficient data processing and manipulation.
TensorFlow: A machine learning framework used to build and train our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Matplotlib: A plotting library that enabled us to visualize model performance, such as accuracy and loss, over time.
Scikit-learn: A powerful library for machine learning in Python, Scikit-learn offers tools for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation, making it easy to implement various machine learning algorithms.
